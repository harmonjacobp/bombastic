This module allows you to push buffers in and read\nfull packets out the other side, so you can get to parsing right away and not have\nto manage concatenating partial buffers and searching through them for packets.\n\n## install\n\n` $ npm install packet-reader `\n\n## example\n\n```js\nvar Reader = require('packet-reader')\n\nvar reader = new Reader()\n//assuming you have a socket emitting `data` events\nsocket.on('data', function(buffer) {\n  reader.addChunk(buffer)\n  var packet = reader.read()\n  while(packet) {\n    //do something with fully parsed packet\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\nhere's a more full featured example:\n\nlet's assume our \"packet\" for our protocol is 32-bit Big Endian length-prefixed strings\nso a \"hello world\" packet would look something like [length, string]\n`[0, 0, 0 0x0B, h, e, l, l, o, w, o, r, l, d]`\n\n```js\nvar Transform = require('stream').Transform\nvar Reader = require('packet-reader')\nvar reader = new Reader()\nvar parser = new Transform()\nparser._transform = function(chunk, encoding, cb) {\n  reader.addChunk(chunk)\n  var packet = reader.read()\n  while(packet) {\n    this.push(packet.toString('utf8'))\n    packet = reader.read()\n  }\n  cb()\n}\n\nvar server = net.createServer(function(socket) {\n  socket.pipe(parser).pipe(stdout)\n})\n\n```\n\nThere are a few config options for setting optional pre-length padding byte.
